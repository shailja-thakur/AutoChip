Here is a Verilog code that builds a circuit that has two 3-bit inputs that computes the bitwise-OR of the two vectors, the logical-OR of the two vectors, and the inverse (NOT) of both vectors. Place the inverse of b in the upper half of out_not (i.e., bits [5:3]), and the inverse of a in the lower half.

```
module top_module (
  input [2:0] a,
  input [2:0] b,
  output [2:0] out_or_bitwise,
  output out_or_logical,
  output [5:0] out_not
);

  assign out_or_bitwise = a | b;
  assign out_or_logical = a | b | 1'b1;

  assign out_not[5:3] = ~b;
  assign out_not[2:0] = ~a;

endmodule
```
