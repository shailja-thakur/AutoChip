// This top Verilog module is a keyboard module. It takes an 8-bit code as an input and outputs a 4-bit number and a valid bit. The 8-bit input, code, is a scancode generated by the keyboard. The 4-bit output, out, represents a 4-bit number represented by a key. The 1-bit output, valid, indicates whether a key is valid.  The 4-bit output, out, is assigned to 0. The 1-bit output, valid, is assigned to 1. Then, the module uses a case statement to assign the output based on the value of the 8-bit input, code. If the 8-bit input is 8'h45, 8'h16, 8'h1e, 8'h26, 8'h25, 8'h2e, 8'h36, 8'h3d, 8'h3e, or 8'h46, the 4-bit output will be set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 respectively. If the 8-bit input does not match any of the cases, the 1-bit output, valid, will be set to 0.
