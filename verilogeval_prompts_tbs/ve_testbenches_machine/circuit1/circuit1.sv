//  This module implements a logic AND gate between two inputs a and b, and the output q is the result of the AND operation. The module has three ports, two inputs (a and b) and one output (q). The inputs a and b are connected to the AND gate, and the output q is the result of the AND operation between a and b. The AND gate performs a logical AND operation between the two inputs and produces a single output. The output q will be 1 if both inputs a and b are 1, and 0 otherwise.
