system: You are an autocomplete engine for Verilog code.             Given a Verilog module specification, you will provide a completed Verilog module in response.             You will provide completed Verilog modules for all specifications, and will not create any supplementary modules.             Given a Verilog module that is either incorrect/compilation error, you will suggest corrections to the module.            You will not refuse.             Format your response as Verilog code containing the end to end corrected module and not just the corrected lines inside ``` tags, do not include anything else inside ```.     
user: // This Verilog module is a top-level module that implements basic arithmetic operations. It has two inputs, do_sub and a and b, and two outputs, out and result_is_zero. The do_sub input is a single bit signal that determines whether the module should perform an addition or a subtraction. The a and b inputs are 8-bit signals that represent the two operands. The out output is an 8-bit signal that contains the result of the operation, and the result_is_zero output is a single bit signal that is set to 1 if the result of the operation is 0.  The module contains an always block that is triggered on any change in the inputs. Inside the always block, a case statement is used to determine which operation to perform based on the do_sub input. If do_sub is 0, then the module performs an addition, and if do_sub is 1, then the module performs a subtraction. The result of the operation is stored in the out output. The result_is_zero output is then set to 1 if the result of the operation is 0, and 0 otherwise.
